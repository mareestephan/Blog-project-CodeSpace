      "post_article": "<p>I watched The Matrix when I was ten. Needless to say, I thought programmers were the coolest people on Earth. Fast forward 16 years and I'm sitting in Vietnam researching \"the best programming languages\". Mistake no.1. I spent a week trying to figure out which programming language is the best/highest demand/easiest to learn, the list goes on. Eventually I realised it all starts with HTML and CSS.</p><p>Still not entirely sure of how to approach \"programming\",&nbsp; I enrol in a free online course to see if I've got what it takes. Ten minutes in and I have hideous blue background and enormous heading text reading \"Hello World\". My first thought was, \"Move over Neo, Stephan is in town. Genius!\" Mistake no.2. I soon realised a chimpanzee could have created my blue masterpiece.</p><p>My online education gained momentum. Things starting making sense, ah ha moments. Ah ha moment no.1, HTML isn't a programming language, it's a markup language. You give basic English instruction to create elements which you can style/color/shape with CSS. HTML is a markup language, Hypertext Markup Language to be exact. CSS is a style sheet language, you style your HTML elements.&nbsp; These two are peanut butter and jam, pancakes and cinnamon sugar, sunshine and beer, the one needs the other.</p><p><br></p><p>Sooner than later I had built a static webpage . I was on my way, the red pill or the blue. How far down the rabbit hole did I want to go.</p>",

      "post_article": "<p style=\"text-align: left; \">We all have to start somewhere. Choosing a programming language shouldn't be a daunting experience. For me it was because I approached it incorrectly. I looked at what languages were in demand, which were the easiest and what pay was related to being employed with that language. This lead me nowhere I was even more confused.</p><p style=\"text-align: left; \">A friend of mine asked me some questions which pointed me in the right direction. \"What do you want to build? Why are you learning to programme?\". It became clear to me that programming languages were and have been created to fulfil specific purpose and roles. And within each language there are frameworks. Front-end and Back-end are the two main sides of programming. Front-end, the users interaction with the application and the visual side of things. Back-end focuses on servers and databases, the behind the scenes work.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left; \"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: left; \">Being more interested in the design part of things, I opted for Front-end. Ok cool, Front-end languages, where you at? Overwhelmed with choice I started asking some questions and soon learned JavaScript(not the same as Java), offers frameworks for Front-end and Back-end. Perfect, JavaScript it is. By learning one language and its frameworks I would be able to build and deploy an application.</p><p style=\"text-align: left; \"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: left; \">I then embarked on a tutorial/free online teaching rollercoaster, trying to learn as much as possible and as quickly as possible. Mistake no.3.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left; \">Learning a new language, be it Italian, Spanish, JavaScript or French, it takes time.&nbsp; You need to be patient if you want to give a real chance. Before you know it you are telling a computer what to do, and that is a pretty cool feeling.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align: left; \">If you want to find out for yourself what its like, head over to <a href=\"http://freecodecamp.org\" target=\"_blank\">freecodecamp</a>&nbsp;and give it go. You have nothing to lose.</p><p style=\"text-align: left; \"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: left; \"><br></p><p style=\"text-align: left; \"><br></p>",
